Your admin dashboard repository is ready! Follow these 3 simple steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new

5. Click **Create repository**

## Step 2: Push Your Code

Copy and paste these commands (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):

cd /Users/jack/admin-master

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/admin-master.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Example** (if your username is `jack108510`):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/jack108510/admin-master.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/admin-master/settings/pages`
2. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Deploy from a branch**
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
3. Click **Save**
